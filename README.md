# Menu_Driven_Application
This C++ menu application offers a versatile set of functions for managing a list of numbers. The application allows you to:

Print List: Display the current list of numbers.
Add Numbers: Append new numbers to the list.
Find Mean: Calculate and display the mean (average) of the numbers in the list.
Find Smallest: Identify the smallest number in the list.
Find Largest: Identify the largest number in the list.
Check Number: Determine if a specific number is present in the list.

This repository serves as a demonstration of C++ programming skills and provides a practical example of creating a text-based menu-driven application. Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference for your own C++ projects.
